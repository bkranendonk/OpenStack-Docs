When creating an Floating IP or an Port with an external network a reverse DNS entry is automatically created.  
The default reverse DNS entry might not be what you want, so you have the ability to change it in the OpenStack Dashboard.

## Floating IP
---
If you want to change your reverse DNS for a floating IP, you can do this in the OpenStack Dashboard.

**Step 1**: First Login on the OpenStack Dashboard and go to the `DNS` tab.  
**Step 2**: Click on the `Reverse DNS` tab.  
**Step 3**: Click on the `Set` button behind the Floating IP you want the change the Reverse DNS for.  
**Step 4**: Enter the new Reverse DNS and click on the `Submit` button. (The new Reverse DNS will be active within 5 minutes)

> Note: When allocating a new Floating IP to your project, you can also set the `DNS Domain` and `DNS Name` to configure the Reverse DNS. (Please make sure the DNS Domain ends with a dot)

## Public / Rented Range / BYoIP
---
If you want to change your reverse DNS for an IPv4/IPv6 address, you can do this in the OpenStack Dashboard.  
Changing the Reverse DNS is a bit more complicated for IPv4 or IPv6 addresses since they are not shown in the Reverse DNS tab like Floating IP's.

**Step 1**: First Login on the OpenStack Dashboard and go to the `DNS` tab.  
**Step 2**: Click on the `Networks` tab.  
**Step 3**: Click on the network in which the target IP address is located. (for example `net-public`)  
**Step 4**: Click on the `Ports` tab.  
**Step 5**: Click on the `Edit Port` button behind the port you want the change the Reverse DNS for.  
**Step 6**: Change the `Name` of the port to the new Reverse DNS you want to set and click on the `Save` button. (The new Reverse DNS will be active within 5 minutes)  

> Note: When creating a new Port in your project, you can also set the `DNS Domain` and `DNS Name` to configure the Reverse DNS. (Please make sure the DNS Domain ends with a dot)

## Private Address Range
---
Setting the reverse DNS for private IP ranges is not supported at this moment, if you would like to
do this we recommend creating an internal DNS server and setting the reverse DNS there. 
If you want to know what the private address ranges are then you can find it in [RFC1918](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1918).
