# Introduction into loadbalancers

In this article, the basic concept of OpenStack Octavia loadbalancers are
explained. This includes the uses, options, benefits and how to create a
loadbalancer.

## Introduction
Loadbalancers can be an essential part of a cloud infrastructure. Loadbalancers
can be used to distribute the incoming traffic to multiple servers. This can in
turn increase the availability of the servers and the applications. OpenStack
Octavia is a loadbalancer service that provides loadbalancing services to the
OpenStack cloud. Octavia is a on-demand and reliable loadbalancer service.
Octavia is a replacement for the older Neutron LBaaS service.

## Types of loadbalancers
There are two types of Loadbalancers in OpenStack Octavia which can be used to
create your Loadbalancer setup.

### Single Loadbalancer
A single loadbalancer setup is a simple setup where a single loadbalancer is
used to distribute the incoming traffic to the backend servers/applications.
This setup is suitable for non-critical applications because if the
loadbalancer fails, the whole setup will be down.

### Active/Standby Loadbalancer (High Availability)
The Active/Standby Loadbalancer setup is a more reliable setup where the standy
loadbalancer will take over the traffic if the active loadbalancer fails. This
setup is highly recommended and essential for critical applications. This setup
can be used to make sure the availability of the servers and applications can
be assured.

### Flavors
Loadbalancer flavors are used to chose between the Single and Active/Standby
Loadbalancer setups. Most of the time, the Active/Standby Loadbalancer setup is
used because of its reliability and availability. Loadbalancer flavors are also
used to define the performance of the loadbalancer. The flavors can be used to
define the performance of the loadbalancer like the number of connections, the
number of requests, the bandwidth, vice versa. Based on your requirements, you
can choose the flavor that suits your needs. Most providers indicate the
performance of the loadbalancer in the flavor description.

## Listeners
Listeners are used to define the incoming traffic to the loadbalancer. The
listeners are used to define the protocol, port, and the [pool](#pools) to
which the traffic should be forwarded.

---

## Pools
A pool is a group of backend servers or applications to which the traffic
should be forwarded. The pools are used to define the protocol, the algorithm,
and the backend servers for the specific [Listener](#listeners).

### Loadbalancer Algorithms
Pool algorithms are used to define the way the traffic should be distributed to
the backend servers.
- **Round Robin**: is used to distribute the traffic to the backend servers in
a circular order.   
- **Least Connections**: is used to distribute the traffic to the backend
servers based on the number of connections towards the backend servers.  
- **Source IP**: is used to distribute the traffic to the backend servers
based on the source IP of the incoming traffic.  

### Session Persistence
Session persistence is used to make sure that the traffic from the same client
is always forwarded to the same backend server. This is used to make sure that
the session data is always available on the same server. This is essential for
applications that require session data to be available on the same server.
OpenStack Octavia currently supports the following Session persistence methods:
- **HTTP_COOKIE**: is used to make sure that the traffic from the same client
is always forwarded to the same backend server based on the HTTP cookie.  
- **APP_COOKIE**: is used to make sure that the traffic from the same client is
always forwarded to the same backend server, uses a hashmap in memory of the
loadbalancer and are less reliable then HTTP cookies.  
- **SOURCE_IP**: is used to make sure that the traffic from the same client is
always forwarded to the same backend server based on the source IP of the
incoming traffic.

## Monitors
Monitors are used to define the health of the backend servers. The monitors are
used to define the protocol, the interval, the timeout, the retries, and the
status of the backend servers. Whenever a backend server or application is
down, the monitor will mark the server as down and the traffic will not be
forwarded to that server anymore. This way you can make sure that the traffic
is only forwarded to the healthy servers to avoid downtime for the users.

---

## SSL Termination (HTTPS)
SSL Termination is used to decrypt the incoming traffic and forward it to the
backend servers. This is used to offload the SSL encryption from the backend
servers. This way the backend servers can focus on the application and the
loadbalancer can focus on the SSL encryption. The storage of the SSL
certificates is be done with OpenStack Barbican (Secret Manager) and can be 
added to the loadbalancers on creation or at a later point. It is required to
use the `TERMINATED_HTTPS` listener  protocol to enable SSL Termination at the
Loadbalancer.

## Where to place your loadbalancer
Chosing the best location for you loadbalancer can be an essential part of the
setup. We recommend checking the geographical location of the backend servers
to make sure the loadbalancer is placed in the desired region/availability
zone (AZ).

Loadbalancers can be used to forward external traffic to the backend servers
but they may also be used to forward internal traffic within your private
network. This is something to keep in mind when desiging your cloud
infrastructure.

## Recommendations
When creating a loadbalancer setup, it is recommended to use the Active/Standby
Loadbalancer setup. This is because of the reliability and availability of the
setup. The Active/Standby Loadbalancer are setup to make sure the availability
of the servers and applications can be assured whenever one of the
loadbalancers fails.

When you create a loadbalancer we recommend to use an Floating IP address for
the loadbalancer. This way we can always swap the IP between loadbalancers in
case you want to upgrade or replace the loadbalancer.

## Conclusion
Loadbalancers can be an essential part of a cloud infrastructure. Loadbalancers
can be used to distribute the incoming traffic to multiple servers. This can in
turn increase the availability of the servers and the applications. OpenStack
Octavia provides a on-demand and reliable loadbalancer service which is easy to
use and manage for your cloud infrastructure.

Now that you know everything you need to know about loadbalancers, you can
start creating your own loadbalancer setup. We highly recommend to read the
article about [creating a loadbalancer with webservers](create-a-loadbalancer-with-webservers.md) to get
started with OpenStack Octavia.
