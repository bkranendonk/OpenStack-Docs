# OpenStack Documentation Guide

A comprehensive guide for creating and managing documentation using MkDocs.

## Getting Started

### Creating a New Article

**Create a new branch**
```bash
git checkout -b <article-name>
```

**Create the article file**
- Navigate to the `docs/` directory
- Create a new `.md` file following this naming convention: `<year>-<month>-<day>-<article-name>.md`
- Place the file in the appropriate category subdirectory: `docs/compute/2023-12-19-create-an-instance.md`

### Article Structure

Create your article using standard Markdown formatting:

```markdown
# Article Title

Your article content goes here using standard markdown syntax.
```

**Guidelines:**
- Use standard Markdown formatting (no special front matter required)
- Organize content with appropriate headers (`#`, `##`, `###`, etc.)
- All articles must be written in English

## Writing Guidelines

### Text Formatting
- Use standard Markdown for all styling
- Keep line length to 79 characters maximum for readability
- The 79-character limit is for editing onlyâ€”publishing removes this constraint

### Hyperlinks

**Internal Links (Same Site)**
```markdown
[Link Text](../path/to/page.md)
```

**External Links**
```markdown
[Link Text](https://external-site.com)
```

### Images

**File Organization**
- Place images in `docs/assets/images/<article-name>/`
- Create a subdirectory for each article

**Image Syntax**
```markdown
![Alt text](../assets/images/<article-name>/<image-name>)
```

## Review Process

### Submitting Articles

1. Create a Pull Request after completing your article
2. Draft PRs are welcome for feedback during development
3. Request review from approved community members
