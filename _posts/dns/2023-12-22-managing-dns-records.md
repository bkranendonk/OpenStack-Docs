Recordsets are used to define the DNS records for a zone. A recordset is a collection of records that
share the same name and type. For example, a recordset named `www.example.com` can contain records for
the `A` and `AAAA` record types. A recordset named `mail.example.com` can contain records for the `MX` record type.

For this guide we assume you have already created a DNS Zone, if you haven't done this yet please follow the the following tutorial: [Create a DNS Zone]({{ '/articles/create-a-dns-zone' | relative_url }})
